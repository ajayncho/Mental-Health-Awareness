# Mental-Health-Awareness
In this project, I used SQL to analyze international studentsâ€™ mental health in Japan by grouping their length of stay and calculating averages for depression, social connectedness, and acculturative stress. The results show longer stays increase depression, reduce connectedness, and highlight cultural stress patterns.
